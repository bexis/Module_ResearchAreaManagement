# Module_ResearchAreaManagement
A tool to manage research areas. You can define the shape of your main plots and draw subplots inside. You can plan the localization of field experiments. You can use maps for orientation in the field. As you will keep the history of the subplots, you will always be able to distribute prospective subplots. Module for Core @BEXIS2.
